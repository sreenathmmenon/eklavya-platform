## üåü The Story Behind Eklavya

In the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, Eklavya learned archery by practicing in front of a statue of the legendary master Dronacharya. Without direct access to the guru, he became one of the greatest archers through dedication and self-learning.

**Today, you can't access tech legends directly. But their AI-powered virtual versions can be YOUR mentors ‚Äî 24/7.**

## The AI Disruption in Indian IT Sector

### Recent Developments (2024-2025)

The Indian IT industry is facing significant workforce transformation driven by AI:

#### Layoffs and Workforce Reduction
- **TCS**: Laying off 2% of workforce (~12,000+ employees) - largest layoffs in company history ([Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/tcs-layoffs-signal-ai-driven-transformation-in-283-bn-outsourcing-sector-125080800567_1.html))
- **Infosys, Wipro, HCL**: Continuing staff reductions despite rising revenues ([Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/tcs-infosys-lay-off-indian-it-sector-job-cuts-automation-ai-reskilling-125072800505_1.html))
- **Industry Impact**: Up to 500,000 IT jobs at risk in next 3 years ([Republic World](https://www.republicworld.com/business/tcs-layoffs-signal-ai-driven-job-shakeup-up-to-500000-indian-it-jobs-at-risk-experts-warn))

#### Worker Anxiety
- **68% of professionals** expect their roles to be partially or fully automated within 5 years
- **4 in 10 workers** fear their current skills will soon be obsolete
- Hiring now focuses on niche talent: AI, cloud, cybersecurity ([Policy Circle](https://www.policycircle.org/industry/tcs-layoffs-ai-jobs-impact/))

#### Industry Response
- **TCS**: Trained 550,000 employees in basic AI skills, 100,000 in advanced skills
- **Infosys**: Developing 100+ generative AI agents to automate client workflows
- **Clear Message**: "Reskill or risk redundancy" ([Medium](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/tcs-layoffs-is-ai-slowly-eating-up-india-69962ee2bec7))

### How Eklavya Helps

**The Problem**: Traditional upskilling is expensive (‚Çπ2-5L) and slow (12-18 months). Workers need immediate, affordable AI education.

**Our Solution**:
- **Free, instant access** to AI learning (no ‚Çπ2L course fees)
- **Practical, hands-on** lessons (not just theory)
- **24/7 availability** (learn while working, no need to quit job)
- **Real AI tools** (Claude API, RAG, prompt engineering)
- **Virtual mentors** (guidance without expensive coaching)

**Impact**: Enables developers to upskill rapidly and affordably, reducing risk of job displacement while staying competitive in the AI-driven market.
