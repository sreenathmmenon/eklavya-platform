# Eklavya - AI-Powered Education & Mentoring Platform

> **Learn AI ‚Ä¢ Compare Models ‚Ä¢ Virtual Mentorship**

## üåü The Story Behind Eklavya

In the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, Eklavya learned archery by practicing in front of a statue of the legendary master Dronacharya. Without direct access to the guru, he became one of the greatest archers through dedication and self-learning.

**Today, you can't access tech legends directly. But their AI-powered virtual versions can be YOUR mentors ‚Äî 24/7.**

## What Is This?

Eklavya is an interactive AI learning platform with three core features:

### 1. üìö **Interactive Learning**
Learn AI concepts through hands-on lessons with real-time feedback:
- **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals**: Compare basic vs well-structured prompts side-by-side
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Paste your own documents and see how context improves AI responses
- **Claude API Integration**: Real-time token tracking, cost analysis, and production-ready examples

### 2. ‚öñÔ∏è **Model Comparison Arena**
Compare up to 16 AI models in real-time with a single prompt:
- **Live API calls** to Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Mistral, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Grok, Sarvam, and Ollama
- **Side-by-side responses** streaming in real-time
- **Performance charts** showing response time, cost, and token usage
- **Data-driven decisions** for choosing the right model for your use case

### 3. üß† **Virtual Mentorship**
Chat with AI personas of legendary tech leaders:
- **Jeff Dean** (Google Senior Fellow) - Distributed Systems, ML at Scale
- **Andrej Karpathy** (Ex-Tesla AI Director) - Deep Learning, Neural Networks
- **Arpit Bhayani** (System Design Expert) - Backend, Scalability
- **Linus Torvalds** (Creator of Linux & Git) - Open Source, Kernel Development
- **Kent Beck** (Creator of XP & TDD) - Software Craftsmanship
- **Paul Graham** (Y Combinator Co-founder) - Startups, Product
- **Reshma Saujani** (Girls Who Code Founder) - Diversity in Tech
- **Steve Ballmer** (Former Microsoft CEO) - Business & Tech Strategy
