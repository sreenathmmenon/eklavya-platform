# 🎯 Eklavya AI - Learn AI from Virtual Legends

> **Enterprise Learning & Mentorship Platform powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5**

Built for the Accel + Anthropic AI Dev Day Hackathon (Oct 1-8, 2024)

---

## 🌟 The Eklavya Story

In the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, Eklavya learned archery by practicing in front of a statue of the legendary master Dronacharya. Without direct access to the guru, he became one of the greatest archers.

**Today, you can't access Jeff Dean, Andrej Karpathy, or Arpit Bhayani directly. But their virtual versions can be YOUR mentors.**

## 🚀 What Is This?

Eklavya AI is a **dual platform** that combines:

### 1. 📚 **Interactive Learning** (like Duolingo for AI)
- **12-week structured curriculum** from beginner to expert
- **Live code editor** with Monaco (VS Code in browser)
- **Gamification**: XP, streaks, levels, achievements
- **Production-ready projects** with AI-assisted development
- Learn: Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, Code Generation

### 2. 🧠 **Virtual Mentorship** (like Topmate with AI)
- **1-on-1 sessions** with AI mentors trained on legendary engineers
- **Jeff Dean** - Google Senior Fellow (Distributed Systems, ML at Scale)
- **Andrej Karpathy** - Ex-Tesla AI Director (Deep Learning, Education)
- **Arpit Bhayani** - System Design Expert (Backend, Redis, DB Internals)
- **Download transcripts** - Every conversation saved as Markdown
